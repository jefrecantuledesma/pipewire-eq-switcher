# pipewire-eq-switcher
## Use
This is a script I've made for myself, and it may not be perfect for your configuration. In order for this script to work, you must have all of your EQs stored in your 
`~/.config/pipewire/pipewire.conf.d/` folder. EQs that are **NOT** the default EQ must have no file extension. The default EQ **MUST** be named `sink-eq6.conf`. Besides that,
everything should work!
